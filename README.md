#AI Agent-Powered Bitcoin Wallet on Stacks

An intelligent crypto wallet built on the Stacks blockchain that allows users to manage Bitcoin and Stacks assets through natural language commands instead of manual clicks. Powered by AI agents, the wallet can:

Parse user prompts (e.g., “Transfer 0.01 BTC to Alice”) and execute blockchain transactions.

Automate investments (e.g., “Invest 50% of my balance into top 3 rising stocks”).

Integrate with Stacks DeFi protocols for staking, liquidity, and yield.

Send notifications & enforce security rules (e.g., no high-risk transfers without confirmation).

Support extensible agents for NFTs, DAO voting, and more.

The project explores the future of AI x Bitcoin L2, making blockchain interactions simpler, safer, and smarter.
