#  AI Agent-Powered Bitcoin Wallet on Stacks

An intelligent crypto wallet built on the **Stacks blockchain** that allows users to manage **Bitcoin and Stacks assets** through **natural language commands** instead of manual clicks.  

Powered by AI agents, the wallet can:  

- **Parse user prompts** (e.g., *“Transfer 0.01 BTC to Alice”*) and execute blockchain transactions.  
- **Automate investments** (e.g., *“Invest 50% of my balance into top 3 rising stocks”*).  
- **Integrate with Stacks DeFi protocols** for staking, liquidity, and yield.  
- **Send notifications & enforce security rules** (e.g., prevent high-risk transfers without confirmation).  
- **Support extensible agents** for NFTs, DAO voting, and more.
