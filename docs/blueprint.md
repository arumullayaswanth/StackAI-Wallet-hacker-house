- Stock Market Data Integration: Fetch stock market data from external APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance) to inform investment decisions.

- DeFi Interaction: Integrate with Stacks DeFi protocols to enable staking, providing liquidity, and withdrawing funds.
- Notification System: Send transaction notifications and daily wallet performance summaries via Telegram/email.
- User Interface for Prompts and Display: Chat-like interface for inputting prompts and displaying wallet balances, transaction history, and agent actions.
